## 7.3.0

**Important notice on MRTD recognizer in the latest PhotoPay SDK release (v7.3.0)**

Please note that we have significantly improved accuracy for MRZ/MRTD scanning because now we switched to the newest OCR technology based on machine learning.
To be more precise, we measured and compared existing vs. new MRTD scanning. The new OCR system based on machine learning achieves 99.9% accuracy on the character level, which results with a 50% reduction in the error rate in MRZ extraction.

In order to use new *MrtdRecognizer* or *MrtdCombinedRecognizer* or to continue using any additional *Recognizer for scanning any ID with the MRZ (machine readable zone)* within the latest PhotoPay SDK update, you *must* have a new license key. Before updating to the SDK version 7.3.0, please contact your account manager or send an email to support@microblink.com to obtain the *new production license key*.

**Important notes**:

- The MRTD scanning with the older PhotoPay SDK versions (v7.2.0 and below) will continue to work without any problems - until you decide to update.
- If you upgrade to the SDK version 7.3.0 without a new license key scanning of MRTD/MRZ documents will not work.
- Contact us at support@microblink.com to obtain a new license key if you plan to update your app with the latest release.

For any questions, you might have, we stand at your service.

- PPOverlayViewController changed the way Overlay Subviews are added to the view hierarchy. Instead of calling `addOverlaySubview:` (which automatically added a view to view hierarachy), you now need to call `registerOverlaySubview:` (which registers subview for scanning events), and manually add subview to view hierarchy using `addSubview:` method. This change gives you more flexibility for adding views and managing autolayout and autoresizing masks.

- Localization Macros MB_LOCALIZED and MB_LOCALIZED_FORMAT can now be overriden in your app to provide completely custom localization mechanisms.

- `PPPhotoPayUiSettings` now has an option to display dots UI effect, when QR code is scanned. To enable it, use:

```objective-c

PPPhotoPayUiSettings *ppUiSettings = [[PPPhotoPayUiSettings alloc] init];
ppUiSettings.displayBarcodeDots = YES;

settings.uiSettings = ppUiSettings;

- Data extraction now exits immediately when user cancels scanning. 

## 4.4.0

- Framework is now distributed as a .framework + .bundle, instead of .embeddedframework. This helps keep resources in a separate "namespace", and avoids mistakes
- The library inside the framework is now static library. This makes it easier to include the library inside other libraries.

    - Improved support for scanning Reference numbers in Slovenina payslips

- Bugfixes and tweaks in camera management code

## 4.3.0

- Added support for scanning recipient name in Hungarian payslips
- Added bitcode support for Xcode 7

## 4.2.0

- iOS 9 introduced new app multitasking features Split View and Slide Over. When the scanner is on screen and one of those features are used, iOS automatically pauses the Camera (this behaviour is default as of iOS 9 beta 5). This SDK version introduces new setting in `PPUISettings` class, called `cameraPausedView`, where you can define the `UIView` which is presented centered on screen when this happens.

- Frame quality estimation can now be enabled using `PPScanSettings frameQualityEstimationMode` property:
    - when set to `PPFrameQualityEstimationModeOn`, frame quality estimation is always enabled
    - when set to `PPFrameQualityEstimationModeOff`, frame quality estimation is always disabled
    - when set to `PPFrameQualityEstimationModeDefault`, frame quality estimation is enabled internally, if the SDK determines it makes sense
    
- Better frame quality estimation: only the sharpest and the most focused frames now go to OCR processing

- `PPScanningViewController` methods `pauseScanning`, `isScanningPaused`, and `resumeScanningAndResetState:` should now be called only from Main thread, and they are effective immediately. E.g., if `pauseScanning` is called and there is a video frame being processed, result of processing of that frame will be discarded, if `resumeScanningAndResetState:` isn't called in the meantime.

- Added support for `PPCameraPresetPhoto` camera preset. Use this if you need the same zoom level as in iOS Camera app. The resolution for video feed when using this preset is the same as devices screen resolution.

- Known issue: if you use Autorotate overlay feature, present `PPScanningViewController` as a modal view controller, and support Split View iOS 9 feature, then autorotation of camera overlays isn't correct. The best way is to opt-out of Split View feature (which Apple suggests for camera-centric apps), and wait for PhotoPay fix when iOS 9 comes out of beta.


## 4.1.1

- Added support for Swiss payslips

## 3.2.1

## 3.1.1
- Added OCR line support for new fonts for UK

## 3.1.0
- Default camera overlay is now improved for a better user experience
- Added support for SEPA payslips in german scanner
- Improved detection of German payslips
- Fixed internal bugs and API inconsistencies

- 3.1.0 includes changes to resource files in the framework. Some resource files were added, some were changed, and some were deleted. To avoid erros in building your app, it's best to remove the old PhotoPay.embeddedframework from your project, and add it again by drag-and-droping the new one to the Frameworks group. 

After that, clean-build your application.

- Fixed crash when Overlay those orientations which are not supported by the app. Now overlay works in that situations.
- Fixes in Austrian Amount and Bank Account number scanning
- Added additonal scanning fields in German QR code scanning

## 3.0.0
- By Semantic versioning, since this version is not completely backwards compatible with previous versions, we increased the Major version number.
- Tweaks to OCR engine and text recognition
- Bugfixes in Austrian OCR recognition
- `PPRecognitionResult` object no longer has convenience properties for, e.g., account number, iban, reference number, etc. You can access that values using `fields` dictionary.
- Changes to API method for retrieving recognition results:

instead of using 

	- (void)cameraViewController:(UIViewController<PPScanningViewController>*)cameraViewController
         	 didFinishWithResult:(PPRecognitionResult*)result;
         
Use:

	- (void)cameraViewController:(UIViewController<PPScanningViewController>*)cameraViewController
            	didOutputResults:(NSArray*)results;
            
New method adds an additional layers of abstraction to result obtaining. It makes possible several new features, most importantly, returning more than one recognition result, and returning results other than payslip scanning results (for example, pure OCR or barcode scanning results).

Objects passed in NSArray* `results` are always of type `PPBaseResult`. `PPRecognitionResult` (object passed in the all callback method) is now a subclass of `PPBaseResult`.

How to implement the new API?

1. Rename `cameraViewController:didFinishWithResult` to, i.e. `processRecognitionResult`
2. Implement `cameraViewController:didOutputResults`. Commonly, it can be implemented in the following way:

		- (void)cameraViewController:(UIViewController<PPScanningViewController> *)cameraViewController
            		didOutputResults:(NSArray *)results {
    		// find the first recognition result and present it.
    		// you can have more complex logic here, which can, for example compare fields in multiple results

    		[results enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
        		PPBaseResult* result = (PPBaseResult*)obj;
        		if ([result resultType] == PPBaseResultTypePhotoPay) {
            		PPRecognitionResult* recognitionResult = (PPRecognitionResult*)result;
            		[self processRecognitionResult:recognitionResult];
            		*stop = YES;
        		}
    		}];

    		[self dismissCameraViewControllerModal:useModalCameraView];
		}
3. Test to see if it works.
